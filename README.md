### Past Project (Hobby)

A past hobby project, which ended development in February 2022, is a game developed on Unity (C#) for iOS. It is a 3D battle-arena style game where the player constructs mechs and battles with them to craft upgrades and advance through a story-mode. The game was in development with an artist friend from the game industry.

The video linked above shows some early mechanics running on an iPhone with a target 60 FPS. There is a lot more I can go into to break down the development on it up to that point, but it will have to wait for a future status update üòä
